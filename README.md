# IntroML-Project
This Project was completed as a midterm for my STAT426 class.
Here we used Machine Learning methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Cross-Fold Validation, and Deep Neural Networks to classify the MNist Fashion Dataset.
Using the code skeleton provided to us, we finished the methods to attempt to correctly classify the fashion data provided to us.
The data set is a very popular set used in the field of ML to see if the method developed is accurate, and can be found on Kaggle
This Project was implemented in R.
